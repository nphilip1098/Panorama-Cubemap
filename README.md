# Panorama-Cubemap
This repository contains an implementation of encoding equirectangular panoramas into a cubemap projection format.[IIT Madras SFRP]

## Abstract

* There has been an explosive growth in multimedia technology and applications in the past several years. Efficient representation for storage, transmission, retrieval and security are some of the biggest challenges faced. 
* Given the proliferation of digital images, and given the high degree of redundancy present in a digital representation of an image (despite compression), there has been an increased interest in using digital images as cover-objects for the purpose of data hiding. 
* Through this project, we will be mainly looking at two main spatial representations of a 360Â° virtual reality image and the interconversions between the two formats.
	* Spherical Projection(Equirectangular Image)	
	* Cube-map Projection
